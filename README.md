### Necessary programs & executables:
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) task runner.
- [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) for rebuilding ink story code.
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/) for building the browser app & running the ink compiler.
    - Highly recommend you install this through a package manager such as [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing dependencies between `inkjs` and `js-src`. 
    - If you installed nodejs via a package manager, you should already have this.
